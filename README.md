# Customer Segmentation and Lookalike Model

This repository contains the solutions for the assignment involving Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation using clustering techniques. The dataset consists of customer, product, and transaction data, and the tasks aim to derive business insights, recommend similar customers, and perform segmentation based on customer profiles and transaction data.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
- **Objective**: Performed EDA on the dataset to uncover key patterns and derived actionable business insights.
- **Deliverables**: 
  - `Sajal_Dhingra_EDA.pdf`: PDF report with business insights (maximum 500 words).
  - `Sajal_Dhingra_EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for EDA.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- **Objective**: Built a Lookalike Model that recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- **Deliverables**: 
  - `Sajal_Dhingra_Lookalike.csv`: CSV file containing the top 3 lookalikes with similarity scores for the first 20 customers (CustomerID: C0001 - C0020).
  - `Sajal_Dhingra_Lookalike.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook explaining the model development.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
- **Objective**: Performed customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Used both profile information (from `Customers.csv`) and transaction information (from `Transactions.csv`).
- **Deliverables**:
  - `Sajal_Dhingra_Clustering.pdf`: PDF report with clustering results, including the number of clusters formed, DB Index value, and other relevant metrics.
  - `Sajal_Dhingra_Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the clustering code.
